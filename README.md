## In this current state of the project the frontend is not hooked up to the frontend. The frontend instead is filled with data from a public movie database, but this data will be replaced with data from the backend API. 

### Frontend 
Contains frontend written in React based on https://github.com/trananhtuat/react-movie 

### Backend 
Written in Python using Flask

### Thesis-project
Contains the source code for the master thesis project with some TV2 related components missing. Requires modifications to be ran without TV2 components / dependencies. (will be updated soon)
